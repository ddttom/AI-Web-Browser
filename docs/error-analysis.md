# Error Analysis and Fix Plan

## Problem Summary
The manual download script successfully downloads model files to the correct location, but the Swift app fails to detect or properly validate these files, resulting in repeated download attempts and MLX validation failures.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Model ID Mapping Mismatch
- **Script downloads to**: `models--mlx-community--gemma-2-2b-it-4bit`
- **App internal model ID**: `gemma3_2B_4bit`
- **App needs to map**: `gemma3_2B_4bit` → `models--mlx-community--gemma-2-2b-it-4bit`

### 2. File Detection Logic Issues
- App's `MLXCacheManager.hasCompleteModelFiles()` method may not be searching the correct directory structure
- The method checks for basic file existence but MLX validation still fails
- Cache directory search logic may be incomplete

### 3. MLX Model Validation Failures
- Files exist and are complete (verified by manual script)
- MLX framework reports "incomplete or corrupted" during validation
- Suggests the issue is in how the app loads/validates the model, not the files themselves

## Manual Download Success Evidence
```
✅ config.json: 4.0K
✅ tokenizer.json: 17M  
✅ tokenizer_config.json: 48K
✅ special_tokens_map.json: 4.0K
✅ model.safetensors: 1.4G
```

Files are at: `/Users/tomcranstoun/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--gemma-2-2b-it-4bit/snapshots/main`

## Root Cause Analysis
The app's smart initialization system is not properly:
1. Mapping internal model IDs to Hugging Face cache directory names
2. Finding the correct snapshot directory structure
3. Validating model files in a way that's compatible with MLX framework expectations

## Fix Strategy
1. Fix model ID to cache directory mapping
2. Improve cache directory search logic
3. Fix MLX model validation approach
4. Ensure proper coordination between manual downloads and app initialization
