## Development & Debugging

### Logging Configuration

The application uses intelligent logging that adapts to build configuration:

#### Production Builds (Release) - v2.11.0
- **Clean Startup**: Only essential status messages shown - emojis and debug tags automatically removed
- **Minimal Output**: Core functionality updates without verbose details or repetitive logging
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Comprehensive system-level error suppression (WebKit, Metal, network warnings)
- **Optimized Performance**: Throttled guard messages and duplicate initialization prevention
- **Professional Experience**: Clean logs suitable for end users

```
AI model initialization started
AI model found - loading existing files  
AI model ready
AI Assistant initialization complete
```

#### Development Builds (Debug)
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full debug information available
- **Performance Tracking**: Detailed startup and cache performance metrics  
- **Troubleshooting**: Extensive diagnostic information

```bash
# Enable verbose logging in debug builds
defaults write com.example.Web App.VerboseLogs -bool YES

# Disable verbose logging  
defaults write com.example.Web App.VerboseLogs -bool NO
```

#### Debug Log Categories
- `üöÄ [SMART INIT]`: AI model initialization flow and state transitions
- `üîç [CACHE DEBUG]`: File system cache operations and validation
- `üöÄ [MLX RUNNER]`: Model loading and execution with container status
- `üì° [ASYNC NOTIFY]`: Async coordination events and notification system
- `‚ö° [SINGLETON]`: Service initialization tracking and lifecycle management
- `üîç [INIT STATE]`: Detailed state tracking during initialization (v2.10.0)
- `üîç [AI READY CHECK]`: Readiness check analysis with reasoning (v2.10.0)
- `üîç [GUARD]`: Coordination logic execution and waiting behavior with throttled logging (v2.11.0)

#### Race Condition Debugging (v2.10.0)
Enhanced debug logging now includes comprehensive state tracking to identify and resolve initialization race conditions:

```bash
# Example debug output showing race condition resolution
üîç [AI READY CHECK] Smart init in progress: true
üõ°Ô∏è [GUARD] Waiting for concurrent initialization to complete  
üîç [GUARD] Smart init completed. Final state: isModelReady=true, downloadState=ready
üî• [INIT AI] MLX AI model now ready after waiting for smart init
```

This prevents false "download needed" messages when model files already exist.

#### Logging Optimizations (v2.11.0)
Enhanced logging system to reduce noise and improve production experience:

**Production Build Improvements**:
- **Message Cleaning**: Automatic removal of emojis and debug tags in release builds
- **System Error Filtering**: Suppression of benign WebKit, Metal, and network warnings
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Guard against multiple initialization attempts causing log spam

**Debug Build Enhancements**:

- **Full Formatting**: Preserves all emojis and debug markers for development visibility
- **Verbose Control**: Fine-grained control via `App.VerboseLogs` UserDefault

```bash
# Reduced logging frequency example (debug builds)
üîç [GUARD] Waiting for smart init... current state: isModelReady=false (every 1s vs 0.2s)
```

## AI Features

## Troubleshooting

### MLX Model Download Issues

If you encounter AI initialization errors:

1. **Automatic Recovery**: The app will attempt to fix corrupted downloads automatically
2. **Manual Recovery**: If automatic recovery fails, run:
   ```bash
   # Standard recovery (skips if files exist)
   ./scripts/manual_model_download.sh
   
   # Force fresh download (re-downloads all files)
   ./scripts/manual_model_download.sh -f
   ```
3. **Clear Cache**: For complete reset, clear existing models first:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/clear_model.sh
   ./scripts/manual_model_download.sh
   ```
4. **Debug Output**: The enhanced manual download script provides detailed debug messages showing:
   - Script execution progress and current location
   - File download attempts and success/failure status
   - Cache directory creation and cleanup operations
   - Error conditions with specific failure points
   - Process coordination and timing information
   - Force mode operations and file management
5. **Cache Management**: Use Settings > Model Management to view and clean cache
6. **Full Documentation**: See [docs/Troubleshooting.md](docs/Troubleshooting.md) for complete recovery steps

### Common Issues

- **"MLX model tokenizer corrupted"**: Run the manual download script
- **"Automatic recovery failed"**: Clear cache manually and restart app
- **"MLX model validation failed"**: Files downloaded but app can't detect them:
  ```bash
  # Verify files are accessible
  ./scripts/verify_model.sh
  
  # Force fresh download if needed
  ./scripts/manual_model_download.sh -f
  ```
- **Network issues**: Check firewall settings for Hugging Face access
- **Disk space**: Ensure 5GB+ free space for model downloads

### Enhanced Troubleshooting Scripts

**Model Verification Script** (NEW):
```bash
./scripts/verify_model.sh
```
This script provides comprehensive validation:
- Directory structure and permissions verification
- File existence, sizes, and accessibility checking
- Path consistency validation between scripts and app expectations
- Detailed debug output with timestamps and status information

**Enhanced Model Clearing Script**:
```bash
./scripts/clear_model.sh
```
Improved features:
- Shows detailed file information before deletion (sizes, counts)
- Calculates total space to be freed
- Provides confirmation prompts for safety
- Removes lock files and incomplete downloads
- Cleans up empty directories automatically

**Complete Model Management Workflow**:
```bash
# 1. Verify current model state
./scripts/verify_model.sh

# 2. Clear corrupted models if needed
./scripts/clear_model.sh

# 3. Download fresh files (force mode ensures clean download)
./scripts/manual_model_download.sh -f

# 4. Verify successful download
./scripts/verify_model.sh

# 5. Start app - should now detect models correctly
```

**Advanced: Standalone Model Conversion**:
```bash
./scripts/convert_gemma.sh
```
For users wanting to convert GGUF models to MLX format:

- Automatic model verification and README generation
- Outputs to standard Web browser cache directory

## Performance Optimizations

Web includes comprehensive performance optimizations for efficient AI initialization and resource management:

### Async/Await AI Initialization

**Problem**: Previous versions used polling-based AI readiness checks causing excessive CPU usage and startup delays.

**Solution**: Implemented async/await pattern with `withCheckedContinuation` for efficient AI readiness coordination:

```swift
// Efficient async waiting instead of polling
let isReady = await mlxModelService.waitForAIReadiness()
if isReady {
    AppLog.debug("‚úÖ AI readiness wait completed successfully")  
} else {
    AppLog.error("‚ùå AI readiness wait failed")
}
```

**Benefits**:
- **Zero CPU overhead**: No polling loops consuming resources
- **Immediate response**: Notification-based wakeup when AI becomes ready
- **Multiple waiters**: Supports concurrent async waiters with single notification
- **Comprehensive logging**: Success/failure tracking for debugging

### Singleton Pattern Implementation

**Services optimized with singleton pattern**:
- `MLXModelService.shared`: Prevents multiple model service instances
- `AIAssistant.shared`: Single AI coordinator instance
- `MLXCacheManager`: Cached expensive filesystem operations

**Performance Impact**:
- Eliminates redundant initialization overhead
- Prevents resource conflicts between multiple instances
- Reduces memory footprint through shared instances

### Intelligent Caching System

**Cache implementations for expensive operations**:

| Operation | Cache Duration | Impact |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Directory validation | 30 seconds | Prevents redundant filesystem scans |
| Manual download checks | 2 seconds | Reduces process check overhead |
| Model readiness state | Session-based | Eliminates repeated validation |

**Cache Hit/Miss Logging**:
```
üéØ [CACHE HIT] Using cached manual download check result
üíæ [CACHE MISS] Performing fresh directory scan - caching for 30s
```

### Debouncing and Rate Limiting

**AI readiness checks now include**:
- **Debouncing**: Prevents rapid successive calls
- **State caching**: Remembers readiness state to avoid rechecks
- **Notification coordination**: Single notification wakes all waiting processes

**Before optimization**: 300+ `isAIReady()` calls during startup
**After optimization**: Single async wait with notification-based completion

### Initialization Guards

**Concurrent initialization prevention**:
- `isInitializationInProgress` flags prevent duplicate startup sequences
- Thread-safe singleton creation with `@MainActor` coordination
- Automatic cleanup of initialization state on completion/failure

### Logging and Debug Information

**Performance monitoring with categorized logging**:
- `üöÄ [ASYNC WAIT]`: Async operation tracking
- `‚ö° [SINGLETON]`: Singleton lifecycle events  
- `üéØ [CACHE HIT/MISS]`: Cache performance metrics
- `üîÑ [DEBOUNCE]`: Rate limiting effectiveness
- `‚è±Ô∏è [TIMING]`: Operation duration tracking

### Measured Performance Improvements

**Startup metrics (before ‚Üí after optimization)**:
- AI readiness checks: 300+ calls ‚Üí 1 async wait
- Model service instances: 3+ concurrent ‚Üí 1 singleton
- Cache directory scans: Multiple per second ‚Üí 1 per 30 seconds
- CPU usage during startup: High polling ‚Üí Minimal notification-based
- Memory usage: Reduced through singleton pattern and caching

### Advanced Model Conversion

For users who want to convert GGUF models to MLX format manually:

```bash
# Install required Python package
pip install mlx-lm

# Run the conversion script
./scripts/convert_gemma.sh
```

**Features:**
- Converts GGUF Gemma models from Hugging Face to MLX format
- 4-bit quantization for optimal Apple Silicon performance
- Automatic model verification and validation
- Creates model README with performance estimates
- Outputs to standard Web browser cache directory

### Build Dependencies

The build process automatically resolves Swift Package Manager dependencies:
- **MLX Swift**: Apple's machine learning framework
- **Swift Transformers**: Hugging Face transformers for Swift
- **Swift Collections**: Advanced collection types
- **Swift Numerics**: Numerical computing support

### Build Troubleshooting

**Database Locked Error:**
If you encounter "database is locked" errors, it means there are concurrent builds running. To fix this:

1. **Kill existing builds:** `npm run kill-builds`
2. **Clean all build data:** `npm run clean:all`
3. **Try building again:** `npm run build`

**Build Location:**
All builds now use a local `./build/DerivedData` directory to avoid conflicts with Xcode's shared derived data location.

**Common Build Issues:**
- **Swift Package resolution fails**: Run `npm run clean:all` and try again
- **Metal shader compilation errors**: Ensure you're on Apple Silicon Mac
- **Memory issues during build**: Close other applications and try `npm run build` (release builds use less memory)

### CI/CD Integration

For continuous integration, use:
```bash
# Clean build for CI
npm run clean:all && npm run build

# Run tests
npm run test

# Create archive for distribution
npm run archive
```
